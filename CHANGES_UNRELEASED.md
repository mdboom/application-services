# Unreleased Changes

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/compare/v0.27.2...master)

## General

### What's Fixed

- Native libraries should now have debug symbols stripped by default,
  resulting in significantly smaller package size for consuming
  applications. A test was also added to CI to ensure that this
  does not regress in future.
  ([1107](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/issues/1107))

## Push

### Breaking Changes

- `PushManager.verifyConnection()` now returns a boolean. `true`
  indicates the connection is valid and no action required, `false`
indicates that the connection is invalid. All existing subscriptions
have been dropped. The caller should send a `pushsubscriptionchange`
to all known apps. (This is due to the fact that the Push API does
not have a way to send just the new endpoint to the client PWA.)
